# Object Detection App

## Overview
The **Object Detection App** is a web-based application that identifies and labels over 50 fruits and vegetables in real-time using a custom YOLOv8 model. This project was developed to provide an intuitive tool for visual recognition tasks and demonstrates the practical application of computer vision and machine learning.  

Built with **Python**, **YOLOv8**, and web technologies (**HTML**, **JSON**), this app combines object detection with an easy-to-use interface for users to quickly identify items from images.

## Features
- Real-time object detection for fruits and vegetables
- Labels detected objects and provides their names
- Supports integration with mechanical systems (e.g., vegetable cutter) for automation
- User-friendly web interface
- Uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model for high accuracy
- Lightweight and efficient, suitable for web deployment

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, HTML, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** YOLOv8, OpenCV, Flask (or FastAPI if used)
- **Data Handling:** JSON for object information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python flask numpy
